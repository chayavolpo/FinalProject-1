# GoogleMaps API key:
In order to run this project you are required a googlemaps API key.
After you get the key you need to paste it in two locations:
1. in the index.html file in the script where you see key = your key.
2. in the shelterLogic file that is in the BL folder in APIMM in the GetDurationOfShelter function where you see key = your key.
